# Tic Tac Toe

## About this Project

Hello! I'm Patrick and I created this virtual Tic, Tac, Toe game.

I built this game as my first ever project as part of my software engineer course I am participating in at General assembly.

To build this project I used a mixture of HTML, CSS and Javascript to showcase the skills I have learnt so far. I decided that I wanted to give this project a very distinct theme, and for it to have a retro gaming feel. I am a big fan of the Synthwave, retrowave aesthetic so decided to theme my game in this style.

To build this project I first created a very basic wireframe using adobe XD. I have exported a png version of this which can be found [here](./Tic-Tac-Toe-Wireframe.png) in the repo.
There is also a copy of the adobe.xd file in the repo if anyone wants to see the original.

## Features
Below is a list of the features I have added to the game which meet and add to the MVP list I was set by the General Assembly Course I am currently part of.

- 2 players can play against each other in games of tic tac toe.
- Their scores from each game are tallied up, including number of wins, losses and ties
- The game is also optimised to be able to play on mobile screen up to 480px in width
- Players can select a preset synthwave color from my colour palette
- Players can also select their own custom colour with the colour picker
- Players can reset the game at any point and start the game from the beginning whilst not loosing their score.
- The game has a retro wave video background to bring the overall synthwave aesthetic to life. The original video file can be found [here](https://pixabay.com/videos/wave-grid-mountains-rainbow-90073/)
- The game also has a synthwave sound track for in game entertainment which start upon clicking the game start button, once players have selected their piece colours. The audio file can be found[here](https://pixabay.com/music/synthwave-lady-of-the-80x27s-128379/)
- I used Classic streetfighter game samples for the start of the game, if somone wins and also when players make their move on the board.

## Challenges

Being my first ever project some of the technology I was using was quite new to me and took me a lot of time to really get my head around how to utilise it. 

Writing the Javascript sections was probably the hardest part of this project as it was very new to me and took a lot of research to find the necessary methods and tools to make this work. 

## My favourite bits on this project

I really love designing and working with css and I feel that it shows on the way this project looks and feels to play. I have learnt a lot of new skills with it too including using css color variables which I had never used before.

I am also really pleased with the colour picker feature and being able to work out how to have the UX I wanted, particulary the box shadow feature, indicates which colour has been selected for each player.

## What I would improve in the future

I would like to improve the winning conditions feature as I know there is probably a much better way of writing these with an array which compares against my array of x's & o's, however I could not work out how to acheive this at the moment. 

I would also like to try and build a AI player which people could then play against, so I may come back and try to imporve this game as  my knowledge and skills progress.

I would like to write more stylesheets to optimise the game for all devices, including tablet.
