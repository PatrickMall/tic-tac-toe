# Tic Tac Toe

## About this Project

[Link to deployed project](https://patrickmall.github.io/tic-tac-toe/)

Hello! I'm Patrick and I created this virtual Tic, Tac, Toe game.

I built this game by myself over 5 days as my first ever project as part of my software engineer course I am participating in at General assembly.

To build this project I used a mixture of HTML, CSS and JavaScript to showcase the skills I have learnt so far. I decided that I wanted to give this project a very distinct theme, and for it to have a retro gaming feel. I am a big fan of the Synthwave, retrowave aesthetic so decided to theme my game in this style.

To build this project I first created a very basic wireframe using adobe XD. I have exported a png version of this which can be found here in the repo. There is also a copy of the adobe.xd file in the repo if anyone wants to see the original.
For this project we were given a very clear brief on what we needed to build and a MVP of these required features.

## MVP requirements

- Render a game board in the browser
- Switch turns between X and O (or whichever markers you select)
- Visually display which side won if a player gets three in a row, or show a draw if neither player wins
- Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files
- Stick with KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles
- Use JavaScript for DOM manipulation
- Deploy your game online, where the rest of the world can access it
- Use semantic markup for HTML and CSS (adhere to best practices)
- Have well-formatted, and well-commented code

User Stories
Below is a list of the user stories that the game was built to achieve:

- As a user, I should be able to start a new tic tac toe game
- As a user, I should be able to click on a square to add X first and then O, and so on
- As a user, I should be shown a message after each turn for if I win, lose, tie or who's turn it is next
- As a user, I should not be able to click the same square twice
- As a user, I should be shown a message when I win, lose or tie
- As a user, I should not be able to continue playing once I win, lose, or tie
- As a user, I should be able to play the game again without refreshing the page

## Features

Below is a list of the features I have added to the game which meet and add to the MVP list I was set by the General Assembly Course I am currently part of.

- 2 players can play against each other in games of tic tac toe.
- Their scores from each game are tallied up, including number of wins, losses and ties
- The game is also optimised to be able to play on mobile screen up to 480px in width
- Players can select a preset synthwave colour from my colour palette
- Players can also select their own custom colour with the colour picker
- Players can reset the game at any point and start the game from the beginning whilst not losing their score.
- The game has a retro wave video background to bring the overall synthwave aesthetic to life.
- The game also has a synthwave sound track for in-game entertainment which starts upon clicking the game start button, once players have selected their piece colours.
- I used Classic street fighter game samples for the start of the game, if someone wins and also when players make their move on the board.

## How to use the app

When loaded the app should look like this:

When the app has loaded players will be asked to select a colour for the counter and then click the "start game" button.
Players can then select the spaces on the board game to place their marker (either x or o, depending on the player).
The game ends when either player gets three in a row, either vertically, horizontally or diagonally.
Players can the play again and the win, loose or tie is recorded to their counter for future games.

## Game winning logic

To work out how the game is won, I built an array of the player places over the course of the game. This array consists of the playersâ€™ choices at the relevant indexes for the game spaces, e.g. 0 - 8 spaces running from top left to bottom right horizontally.
This array is then checked against the potential 8 winning space combinations everytime a player makes a move. When any of these conditions have become true, the game ends and the player gets the winning message.

## Build

Below are two bits of code I would like to highlight as parts that I feel are some of the best features I built with this project.
Music fades out on game ending.
I wanted the music to not abruptly cut out as soon as the winner won the game or when the game was reset as I was quite jolting and not a smooth transition. For this, I looked into ways I could build a fade out on completion of the game. And eventually built a fade out function that utilised a setInterval to slowly decrease the audio volume.

```javascript
// Fade out function for music when player wins or ties
let interval;
const fadeOut = function () {
  interval = setInterval(volumeControl, 50);
};
// Volume controller for fade out function
const volumeControl = function () {
  if (audio.volume > 0.01) {
    audio.volume -= 0.01;
  } else {
    clearInterval(interval);
    audioStop();
    audio.volume = 0.5;
  }
};
```

Colour picker box shadow highlighter to show which colour has been selected
This group of functions turned out to be one of the more complicated parts of my project as I had to work between not only the presets I had provided but also if someone chose their own colour from the colour picker, then I needed to highlight that instead of the preset. I wanted to be able to write one function that would do this logic for both players, but I could not work out how to do this so I duplicated the code for each player.

Here is the example of the colour picker box shadow

```javascript
// Color picker function for player 1
presetColorBoxes1.forEach((box) => {
  box.addEventListener("click", (e) => {
    boxShadowClearer1();
    for (let i = 1; i <= colorPicker.length; i++) {
      if (e.target.id === `player-1-box-${i}`) {
        colorPickerAddColor(e, i - 1, 1);
        player1Color = colorPicker[i - 1];
      }
    }
  });
});

// Box shadow remover functions that clears all the shadows when player clicks on new color picker box
const boxShadowClearer1 = function () {
  const boxArray = Array.from(presetColorBoxes1);
  boxArray.forEach((element) => {
    element.style["boxShadow"] = "0 0 0 white";
  });
};
const boxShadowClearer2 = function () {
  const boxArray = Array.from(presetColorBoxes2);
  boxArray.forEach((element) => {
    element.style["boxShadow"] = "0 0 0 white";
  });
};

// Color picker function for player 2
presetColorBoxes2.forEach((box) => {
  box.addEventListener("click", (e) => {
    boxShadowClearer2();
    for (let i = 1; i <= colorPicker.length; i++) {
      if (e.target.id === `player-2-box-${i}`) {
        colorPickerAddColor(e, i - 1, 2);
        player2Color = colorPicker[i - 1];
      }
    }
  });
});

// Adds colors to player
const colorPickerAddColor = function (e, colorArr, player) {
  rootSelector.style.setProperty(
    `--pickedPlayer${player}`,
    colorPicker[colorArr]
  );
  e.target.style["boxShadow"] = `0 0 20px white`;
  if (player === 1) {
    customColor1.style["boxShadow"] = `0 0 0 white`;
  } else if (player === 2) {
    customColor2.style["boxShadow"] = `0 0 0 white`;
  }
};
// Player 1 custom color picker
player1customColorBtn.addEventListener("submit", function (e) {
  e.preventDefault();
  boxShadowClearer1();
  player1Color = customColor1.value;
  rootSelector.style.setProperty(`--pickedPlayer1`, player1Color);
  customColor1.style["boxShadow"] = `0 0 20px white`;
  const submitBtn1 = document.querySelector(".color-select-1");
  submitBtn1.setAttribute("value", "Selected");
});

// Player 2 custom color picker
player2customColorBtn.addEventListener("submit", function (e) {
  e.preventDefault();
  boxShadowClearer2();
  player2Color = customColor2.value;
  rootSelector.style.setProperty(`--pickedPlayer2`, player2Color);
  customColor2.style["boxShadow"] = `0 0 20px white`;
  const submitBtn2 = document.querySelector(".color-select-2");
  submitBtn2.setAttribute("value", "Selected");
});
```

As you can see from the code I had to add a clearer function that removed the box shadow from the previous choice as the array of presets and colour picker were separate elements in my application.

## Challenges

Being my first ever project some of the technology I was using was quite new to me and took me a lot of time to really get my head around how to utilise it.
Writing the JavaScript sections was probably the hardest part of this project as it was very new to me and took a lot of research to find the necessary methods and tools to make this work.

## My favourite bits on this project

I really love designing and working with css and I feel that it shows on the way this project looks and feels to play. I have learnt a lot of new skills with it too including using CSS colour variables which I had never used before.
I am also really pleased with the colour picker feature and being able to work out how to have the UX I wanted, particularly the box shadow feature, indicating which colour has been selected for each player.
What I would improve in the future

My biggest learnings from this project was gaining a much deeper understanding of JavaScript than I had previously had. I also learnt a lot about ways I can use CSS animations to create smooth transitions and seamless cool aesthetics to web applications.
I would like to improve the winning conditions feature as I know there is probably a much better way of writing these with an array which compares against my array of x's & o's, however I could not work out how to achieve this at the moment.
I would also like to try and build an AI powered player which people could then play against, so I may come back and try to add to this game as my knowledge and skills progress.
I would like to write more stylesheets to optimise the game for all devices, including tablets.
